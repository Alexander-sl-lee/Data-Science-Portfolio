    "Great! We have a good thing going. With the accuracy that we have we'd make bank in no time. Or will we? According to a study set by Victor Haghani & Richard Dewey in 2016 suggested otherwise. In their study 61 people young men and women were given \\$25 and 30 minutes to bet on a coin 300 times, of which they were allowed to keep their winnings up to a cap of $250.\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch? The coin was biased. They were advised ahead of time that the coin would flip heads 60% of the time, and that their bets were double or nothing. Now with a simple percentage betting strategy. 95% of the time you should be able to reach the maximum payout.\n",
