KUDFS\u2019s goal is to foster productive multi-disciplinary collaboration among different departments on KU camps and local industry. To reach the goal, KUDSF aims to bring together a wide range of Big Data stakeholders on KU campus to work on difficult and impactful societal problems with data-driven approaches. The University of Kansas has a long tradition of supporting interdisciplinary work. The KU campus houses a group of internationally recognized research centers such as the Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, Achievement and Assessment Institute, Biodiversity Institute, Institute for Policy & Social Research (IPSR) among others and provides an excellent environment to perform data science research.   KUDFS is composed of KU Data Science Postdoctoral Associates and KU Data Science Faculty Fellows. The KU Data Science Postdoctoral Associates can be housed in any department at the KU school of Engineering. The successful candidates are usually co-mentored by two Data Science Faculty members. Postdoctoral Fellows are appointed to an initial one-year term with the possibility of contract renewal with satisfying progresses. In the following non-exclusive list we highlight a few concentration areas on which Postdoctoral Fellows may work.   Focus Areas:  Data genres/data modalities. Many different data science applications may process the same/similar types of data. For example, linked data (e.g. graphs or networks) are widely utilized in business analytics, healthcare informatics, social science, journalism, city and community management, smart transportation etc. Recognizing the common data modalities in different applications and developing related analytics capability that may be applicable to a range of applications play a central role in data science.   Machine Learning Model sharing, reuse, and serving. With the fast accumulation of modeling algorithm, meta-analysis of a group of machine learning algorithms for applications is important. The related topics in these areas are: automated model construction and parameter tuning, model comparison, model life-cycle management, collaboration in ML model, and model reproducibility.   Open Knowledge Network. In order to support the effective communication between domain experts and modelers, between machine and human experts, and the precise description of machine learning models, it is necessary to construct efficient knowledge representation and related analytics for different applications. Knowledge network is an emerging field that covers topics such as effective knowledge representation, information trustworthiness, and efficient querying methods and reasoning with digitalized domain knowledge.   Fair and transparent data science. Data science products are starting to become widely utilized in many parts of our society. Examples of such data science products including intelligent job hunting, product recommendation, news recommendation, and smart transportation etc. Public sectors start to adopt data science product and utilize them in offering public services. However the modeling processing behind those products is usually opaque and may inherit/reinforce existing bias toward minority groups in our society. Recognizing, preventing, and mitigating algorithmic bias demand interdisciplinary research efforts involving collaboration between technical, policy, and legal disciplines.   Data Science Applications/Collaboration with Industry. We encourage scientists to work on novel data science applications. Such applications may be from areas such as smart and connected communities, smart and connected health, K-12 education among others.

Preference is given to applicants who request a research facility other than the one where the doctoral degree was obtained.   Preferred skills   Participants should have skills and/or experience in topics addressed by this program:  Experimental Plasma Physics Theoretical Plasma Physics Computational Plasma Physics Plasma-Material Interfacial Science Fusion Materials Science Plasma Control Science Advanced Diagnostics Research supported in this program must be directed toward addressing problems at the frontiers of plasma science, specifically in the following areas:   Transients   A main goal of tokamak research is to use magnetic plasma confinement to develop the means of operating high-pressure fusion plasmas near stability and controllability boundaries while avoiding the occurrence of transient events that can degrade performance or terminate the plasma discharge. Various events can lead to the sudden release of thermal and magnetic stored energy to plasma facing components, potentially damaging device components. Two events of particular concern are edge localized modes (ELMs) and disruptions. ELMs may drive repetitive (approximately 1 Hz) pulses of up to 10 percent or more of the plasma stored energy to the walls in ITER while disruptions may completely terminate the discharge, releasing all of the plasma\u2019s thermal and magnetic energy into nearby structures and potentially producing a runaway electron population that may cause localized damage. Present estimates indicate that sustained fusion performance in ITER and later reactors will require large reductions in the magnitude and frequency of both ELMs and major disruptions. A great deal of progress has been made in avoiding and mitigating the impact of transients and the United States is a world leader in addressing the challenges, particularly in identifying innovative control solutions and in understanding the relevant physic mechanisms to support extrapolation of these solutions to reactor-scale tokamaks.   Plasma-Materials Interactions   The pronounced science challenges associated with plasma-materials interactions (PMI) in confined fusion devices are enormous. These challenges include physical phenomena that occur over a vast range of length and time scales, and involve processes from, and interactions between, plasma edge physics and material science. New PMI solutions are required for practical heat and particle exhaust in future plasma systems as these considerations limit the operating space and drive the overall size and cost of net-energy producing fusion systems. Over the past decade, a number of both domestic and international strategic planning activities have highlighted PMI as a major knowledge gap and recommend that it be a priority for fusion research towards ITER and conceptual prototype reactors. Therefore, PMI research offers opportunities to advance the science of both plasma and materials, and the potential for new discoveries arising from their interactions.   Integrated Simulations for Magnetic Fusion Energy Sciences   The high cost of building future experiments and prototype fusion facilities, such as the ITER device, combined with the complexity of these systems and the advances expected in extreme-scale computing over the coming decade provide strong motivation for developing integrated simulation capabilities. Such tools aim to predict the key physical processes in these devices thus minimizing risk to the device and guaranteeing its successful operation. Two key components of this simulation effort involve (1) disruption prediction, avoidance, and mitigation (\u201cdisruption physics\u201d), and (2) plasma pedestal and scrape-off layer physics (\u201cplasma boundary physics\u201d). Simulations in these areas are an integral part of research in the Transients and Plasma-Materials Interface areas.   In the disruption physics area, integrated simulation of all stages and forms of tokamak disruptions, with and without mitigation, are needed, and will require improving multiscale, multi-physics algorithms, managing large amounts of computational data, and taking advantage of new extreme-scale computing opportunities. Linear and nonlinear computational models must be validated in order to establish confidence in the prediction and understanding of tokamak disruption physics with and without mitigation.   In plasma boundary physics, models require integration of multiple physical processes that cover a wide range of overlapping spatial and temporal scales, from the hot, confined pedestal zone with sharp gradients, to the cooler unconfined edge and divertor plasma, and finally to the first few microns of the wall itself. As demonstrated in the recent past, these simulations will continue to benefit from expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, and high-performance computing. Required capabilities include kinetic turbulence simulations, related three-dimensional fluid simulations with gyro-Landau kinetic extensions, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of materials, and couplings of lower-dimensional models (for fast analyses) to simulate interactions between zones and particle species.   Plasma Science Frontiers   The Frontiers of Plasma Science involve research in largely unexplored areas of plasma physics, with a combination of theory, computer modeling, and experimentation. The plasma science frontier is often, but not limited to, the extremes of the plasma state, ranging from the very small (several atom systems) to the extremely large (plasma structure spanning light years in length), from the very fast (attosecond processes) to the very slow (hours), from the diffuse (interstellar medium) to the extremely dense (diamond compressed to tens of gigabar pressures), and from the ultracold (tens of micro kelvin) to the extremely hot (stellar core). Advancing the science of these unexplored areas creates opportunities for new and unexpected discoveries with potential to translate into practical applications."},

Berkeley\u2019s culture of openness, freedom and acceptance\u2014academic and artistic, political and cultural\u2014make it a very special place for students, faculty and staff.   Berkeley is committed to hiring and developing staff who want to work in a high performing culture that supports the outstanding work of our faculty and students. In deciding whether to apply for a staff position at Berkeley, candidates are strongly encouraged to consider the alignment of the Berkeley Workplace Culture with their potential for success at http://jobs.berkeley.edu/why-berkeley.html.   Departmental Overview   The Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS \u2013 http://bids.berkeley.edu ) was founded in fall  2013 to act as a central campus hub for the development and application of cutting-edge data  science techniques in the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, and humanities.  The Institute aims to build on the many recent innovations in data science techniques so that  they can be applied in effective ways to domain science challenges.   The Institute brings together researchers across disciplines through a number of pathways  including fellowships, postdocs, memberships, and staff appointments  ( https://bids.berkeley.edu/people ). We host a variety of activities (lectures, hackathons,  bootcamps) to help train the next generation of data scientists, and support a growing  portfolio of software development and research projects ( http://bids.berkeley.edu/research ).  We have built a vibrant and friendly Data Science Environment that attracts and supports  researchers from all fields. BIDS collaborates closely with the new Division of Data Sciences  ( http://data.berkeley.edu ) and the undergraduate Data Science Education Program.   The open-source, community-developed, scientific Python ecosystem plays a central role in  many of these efforts, and the foundation of this ecosystem is the NumPy library.

The  codebase, which by now is over 20 years old, is starting to show its age, and a slow creep of  technical debt. And given NumPy's foundational role, any problems it suffers affect the entire  scientific Python community.   BIDS is now looking to hire programmers to join us in developing NumPy. This is a  grant-funded opportunity to do full-time open source development, and work together with the  NumPy community, BIDS fellows, and the larger scientific Python community to unlock  powerful new capabilities for NumPy\u2019s millions of users, and put NumPy development on a  more sustainable footing for it\u2019s next 20 years.

Their proudest moments happen when hospital and health system leaders use those ideas to achieve lasting success.  The Details: Research teams tackle common issues that affect the health care industry as a whole. Across the course of several months, they dive deep into a single issue using interviews, surveys, data analysis, and secondary research.

Researchers then communicate these findings to members via national meeting presentations, web conferences, books, whitepapers, toolkits, infographics, and more.

Research analysts are motivated by the intersection of ideas and impact; they are passionate about getting to the bottom of things and enjoy a good debate. Seeing their ideas in print isn\u2019t enough. Research teams directly interact with hospital executives, learning from their experiences and influencing change at member hospitals through presentation of key research findings. Their proudest moments happen when hospital and health system leaders use those ideas to achieve lasting success.   The Details:  Research teams tackle common issues that affect the health care industry as a whole. Across the course of several months, they dive deep into a single issue using interviews, surveys, data analysis, and secondary research. A research cycle is successful when the team can fully articulate the root causes underlying a problem as well as the most successful solutions to addressing it. Researchers then communicate these findings to members via national meeting presentations, web conferences, books, whitepapers, toolkits, infographics, and more. Because real impact is achieved only when members implement our ideas, Research staff routinely travel on-site to hospitals and speak to health system executives via phone to help them select the best next steps for their organization. Working in teams provides analysts the opportunity to learn from peers and to take on more challenging responsibilities as they develop in their role.   Recent topics covered include: health care reform, the Emergency Department capacity crisis, the growing burden of bad debt in hospitals, evaluating the latest clinical technologies, and implementing electronic medical records.
