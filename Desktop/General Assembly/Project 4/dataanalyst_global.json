IHME carries out a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Forecasting; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Geospatial Analysis; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. The aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.   IHME is hiring for multiple Data Analyst positions on a number of different teams . We review and interview applicants on a rolling cycle. All applications received by December 31st will be included in this round of reviews. Those received after December 31st will be reviewed in the next round. Interviews for this round will be scheduled on January 16th, 17th and 18th. Placement onto a team is determined by specific needs of the team and candidates' qualifications.   The main purpose of these positions is to provide support to key research projects through database management, data quality management, computational support to multi-disciplinary research projects, data extraction and formatting, and providing key inputs for papers and presentations. Data Analysts must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. Data Analysts must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data.   These positions call for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages (Stata, Python, R, SQL). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability. Please note: These positions are open to U.S. Citizens and permanent residents; H1B visa sponsorship is not available.   Research Teams for which Data Analyst positions are currently available include:   Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD) : A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD\u2019s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.   Geospatial Analysis: IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes.   Central Computation: At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another.   Resource Tracking: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution.   Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness: This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future.   Primary Data Collection: IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis. This position will help with data quality management through an intensive period of data collection and will be instrumental in helping to present the key summary results derived from the data.

{"id": "p_36561326e6f2748d", "company": "Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation - Facu...", "title": "Data Analyst", "loc": "Seattle, WA", "summary": "The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to monitor global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate interventions, initiatives, and reforms. IHME carries out a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Forecasting; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Geospatial Analysis; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. The aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.   IHME is hiring for multiple Data Analyst positions on a number of different teams . We review and interview applicants on a rolling cycle. All applications received by November 5th, 2017 will be included in this round of reviews. Interviews for this round will be scheduled on November 28 - 30th. Placement onto a team is determined by specific needs of the team and candidates' qualifications.   The main purpose of these positions is to provide support to key research projects through database management, data quality management, computational support to multi-disciplinary research projects, data extraction and formatting, and providing key inputs for papers and presentations. Data Analysts must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. Data Analysts must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data.   These positions call for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages (Stata, Python, R, SQL). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability. Please note: These positions are open to U.S. Citizens and permanent residents; H1B visa sponsorship is not available.   Research Teams for which Data Analyst positions are currently available include:   Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD): A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD\u2019s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.   Geospatial Analysis: IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes.   Central Computation: At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another.   Resource Tracking: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution.   Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness : This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future.   Primary Data Collection : IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis. This position will help with data quality management through an intensive period of data collection and will be instrumental in helping to present the key summary results derived from the data.

This work begins with an understanding of the workflows of intelligence analysts and military commanders, often through operations research. Operational data sets are amassed to support all types of algorithm development, such as multisensor fusion, \u201cbig data\u201d mining, cloud technologies, graph-based network detection, and artificial intelligence, including deep learning. The group guides the nation in the adoption of open architecture standards in air, space, and cyber platforms. Prototype systems for data exploitation and knowledge management are delivered for evaluation in theater. Areas of technical staff expertise include systems analysis, modeling and simulation, feature extraction and pattern analysis, computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, software development, and field experimentation.   Job Title: Summer Research Intern in Clustering with Probabilistic Programming   Position Description: As more and more features are aggregated together to attempt to extract meaning from data, it will be nearly impossible to collect all features for all measurements. To address this problem, algorithms are needed that can naturally account for missing features in multivariate data sets. Previous research has led to algorithms that can cluster multivariate Gaussian data with missing features in measurements. The summer research project will be to develop more advanced algorithms that can handle missing data. The current interest is in algorithms that can model prior distributions on cluster means and covariance matrices with the normal-Wishart distribution while still accounting for missing data fields. At this time, an analytic solution to the derivation of the posterior probability distribution is unknown. An alternative approach is to use numerical integration.   The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm to cluster data with missing fields with a probabilistic programming language. The project will require the development of a few different approaches to clustering multivariate data with missing data. The distributions will be restricted to normal, Wishart and T distributions. A probabilistic programming language will be used to write a variety of programs that numerically solve the required integrals to produce posterior estimates and to estimate the optimal assignments of incomplete data to clusters.   Requirement: The candidate should be enrolled in a BS, MS or PhD degree program with a major in electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, physics, or a related field.   Desired Skills: The ideal candidate should have a firm grasp of Bayesian probability theory, statistics, integral calculus, linear algebra and the ability to program effectively in a probabilistic programming language. Experience with fourth-generation languages (MATLAB, R, or equivalent), machine learning algorithms, and data analysis techniques are highly desirable.

This work begins with an understanding of the workflows of intelligence analysts and military commanders, often through operations research. Operational data sets are amassed to support all types of algorithm development, such as multisensor fusion, \u201cbig data\u201d mining, cloud technologies, graph-based network detection, and artificial intelligence, including deep learning. The group guides the nation in the adoption of open architecture standards in air, space, and cyber platforms. Prototype systems for data exploitation and knowledge management are delivered for evaluation in theater. Areas of technical staff expertise include systems analysis, modeling and simulation, feature extraction and pattern analysis, computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, software development, and field experimentation.   Job Title: Software Architectures for Big Data   Project Description: The military\u2019s analysis and workflow processes rely heavily on large amounts of source data in many different formats, ranging from high resolution imagery to chat messages. In order to provide real-time capabilities to end users, Lincoln software has to be both optimized and easy to iterate on as new requirements are identified. To meet these goals, a number of techniques must be utilized (e.g. configuration management for deployment to a wide variety of field sites, breaking down applications into manageable micro services, and testing prototype architectures to ensure robustness and correctness).   This project will explore some of the newer software design concepts, such as micro services, as they relate and can be applied to existing software systems in use by the military today. For example, one such system involves the parsing of user-entered text messages and identifying the meaning of particular fields supplied by the operator. Natural language processing, which is not currently utilized for the task, could be applied to improve results, and a testing framework would be useful to validate results. Furthermore, this existing system is part of a large set of services, many of them web-based REST services, utilized by Lincoln that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more configurable components in the spirit of micro services. The goal of the project would be to identify and prototype improved architectures for such existing systems.   Requirements: The candidate should be pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree in computer science, mathematics, electrical engineering, or a related field.
