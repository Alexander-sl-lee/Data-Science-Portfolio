We\u2019ve built an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) platform dedicated to support disparate internal and external data sources. The platform has been built leveraging mostly open-source tools on Google Cloud Platform.   This position is part of the Enterprise Data & Analytics team, a high-performance group chartered with delivering a beautifully simple analytics foundation and service that allows Zendesk to scale to a $1 Billion company with clearly defined, consistent metrics and a data architecture that provides all business operations with high quality and timely analytics for optimal decision making.

Regularly report on key health metrics to leadership (Directors, VPs, C-suite), and optimize the presentation and process to make it as effective and efficient as possible. Support business leaders with ad-hoc data delving that will substantiate or disprove health-related hunches, and create work-lists of at-risk customers to drive high-urgency solutions. Use customer data, cross-referenced against customer success programs, to identify whether (and how much) our offerings are helping our customers. Queue-up data to both celebrate our success, and learn from our gaps and deficiencies.

Like all analytics teams, we believe that extracting actionable insight from data is the bedrock of good decision-making ... where we differ is in two key beliefs. First, the best decisions rely not solely on data, but also on intuition grounded in years of knowledge and experience. Second, if we only do marketing that we can easily or cleanly measure, we will fail.   If you thrive in a culture of healthy debate and are just as comfortable standing up for your ideas as you are changing your mind in the face of compelling evidence, logic, or intuition, then we want to hear from you.

Here, success is measured in terms of impact on marketplace efficiency   2. Machine learning: the ongoing development of the machine learning infrastructure that enables continuous learning from our data, where success is also measured in terms of marketplace efficiency gains as well as the rate at which different aspects of the user experience are incorporated into our ML systems   3. Scaling user testing: the parallelization and democratization of end-user testing across all aspects of the product and user experience, where success is measured in terms of testing velocity across the organization   What we're looking for:  The Senior Data Scientist at Rover will possess broad enough experience to contribute to each of the three classes of problem outlined above, while also being deep enough to lead at least one of them end-to-end. In every case, and regardless of the specific techniques employed, the Senior Data Scientist will be responsible for managing long-running experiments with significant impact on how users interact with Rover.com , participate in our marketplace, and find care for their dogs. This is a non-trivial responsibility: on the one hand, there is tremendous value to be driven in continuing to optimize the Rover marketplace, while on the other hand the opportunity cost associated with long-running experiments (in time and dollars) is very high.   For this reason, real-world experience in this class of problem is a requirement, and experience working in an online marketplace specifically is strongly preferred.   Your toolset includes: SQL Python Probably at least one additional programming language / computational programming environment; e.g., R, Matlab, C++, etc Google Analytics or similar user funnel analytics tools Tableau, Looker, or similar data visualization tools Data-informed decision making with rigorous split testing. Integrated teams with developers, designers and analysts working side-by-side. Dogs in the office. Bring yours, too! Why we\u2019ll hire you: You are familiar with more than just the basics, and have more than cursory experience with at least sub-discipline in the broad field of data science. In other words, you know where the sharp edges are, and can lead decisions around what techniques are and are not appropriate to employ for particular classes of problem You\u2019re a deeply analytical thinker who is passionate about finding structure in data, and using data to drive real value to the end user (and thus the business). You are passionate about our core business. You will instinctively dig into every aspect of what it means to be a dog sitter and a dog owner on the Rover platform. You can take abstractly defined problems and work with (imperfect) data to drive decisions You are a great partner to engineers and business owners alike You can pitch your own ideas and shepherd them through to completion You show pattern of being self-started, self-taught and self-directed You favor open communication with willingness to ask and answer questions You are output- and outcome-oriented You have excellent written and verbal communication skills You play nicely with others (and dogs) Your qualifications B.S in a quantitative discipline required; advanced degree (MS or PhD) preferred Strong technical and coding skills Deep expertise in one or more core data science disciplines (e.g, supervised learning, machine learning, etc) Marketplace experience strongly preferred Experience in online user testing strongly preferred   Benefits of Working at Rover.com: Competitive compensation 4 weeks paid time off 401k Stock options Competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision insurance Commuter benefits Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time) Doggy benefits, including $1000 toward adopting your first dog Extra PTO you can earn by dog sitting Stocked fridges, coffee, soda, and lots of treats (for humans and dogs) Free catered lunches twice a month Regular team activities, including happy hours, snow tubing, game nights, and more   This position is based at Rover HQ in Downtown Seattle.

The use of data and analytics across the R&D organization has become a critical imperative in the transformation of our business. GSK's R&D Data Centre of Excellence (CoE) group is leading the path for innovative data management and was recently recognized with the \u2018Rookie of the Year' Data Impact Award by Cloudera, Inc. Mark Ramsey, SVP and R&D Chief Data Officer, has been leading the CoE since mid-2015 to bring efficiencies to three areas in R&D including big data platform builds; innovation and incubation; and data science and analytics. So far, they are delivering ground-breaking technology in a single data platform that will give GSK scientists access to data like never before.  \"We were not taking full advantage of the vast amount of data generated throughout R&D because it was in silos and difficult to access,\" said Ramsey. \"We essentially collected more than 10 years of biological data regardless of when, how, and where it was generated, then bundled it into a single, central platform. Scientists now have the information at their fingertips and can quickly search data in a couple of clicks.\"  The vision is for GSK to be at the leading edge in the use of data to drive decisions.
