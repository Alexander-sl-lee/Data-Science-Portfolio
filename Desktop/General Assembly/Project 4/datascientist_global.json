This appointment will be served at the EPA Main Campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.   The National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) and Rapid Exposure and Dosimetry (RED) project are both comprised of scientists, technologists, post docs, and student researchers with backgrounds from diverse scientific disciplines.   The NCCT is responsible for developing new computational tools and providing quantitative analysis for improving environmental risk assessments and regulatory decisions pertaining to chemical safety and sustainability (http://epa.gov/ncct/). There are tens of thousands of chemicals that are currently in commerce, with hundreds more introduced every year. Many of these chemicals find their way into the environment and only a small fraction have been adequately assessed for potential risk. The NCCT is working with its partners to revolutionize how we assess chemical toxicity risk to humans and the environment.   The RED project team, led by John Wambaugh and Kristin Isaacs, works to increase the pace and effectiveness at which relevant information on chemicals with environmental exposures can be obtained. Estimates of human and ecological exposures are required as critical input to risk-based prioritization and screening of chemicals. Our project seeks to develop the data, tools, and evaluation approaches required to generate rapid and scientifically-defensible exposure predictions for the full universe of existing and proposed commercial chemicals.   The participant will be involved in some of the following training activities addressing critical environmental protection needs:  Bayesian evaluation of the predictive ability of mathematical models for chemical exposure using environmental monitoring data (e.g., surface water concentrations)   Inference of loading of environmental chemicals into U.S. waterways using exposure models and water sampling data   Implementation, parameterization, and revision of mathematical models for chemical exposure   Informatics and \u201cBig Data\u201d analytics using machine learning approaches   Predicting relevant exposure pathways for individual chemicals from structure features   Assessing domain of applicability for chemical property predictors using data from high throughput property measurements and quantitative-structure activity relationships (QSARs)   Parallelize and otherwise refine model calculations to best use multi-core computer resources.

What makes Gartner a GREAT fit for you?  The Research Board (RB) is a division of Gartner dedicated to analyzing the strategic issues confronting the Chief Information Officers at the world\u2019s largest, most complex organizations ($10 billion in revenue or higher). The CIO leads the enterprise\u2019s strategy for using technology to achieve the company\u2019s business objectives. Today, our members face massive challenges including disruption from startups, entirely new business models, and massive re-organizational efforts. The mission of the RB is simple: to do the big picture, forward looking conceptual thinking about such challenges that CIOs faced with pressing strategic concerns do not always have the time or bandwidth to do.  About this role: Every year, the RB invites a small group of highly talented individuals to join the firm as research analysts (RAs) within the RB\u2019s research department. RAs form the core of the RB\u2019s research teams, distilling findings from a variety of sources and presenting it in a way that is consumable for senior technology executives. Research topics reside on the cutting edge of CIO agendas, meaning that RAs must exercise a free hand to explore questions for which there are no easy or rote answers.  Being an RA at the RB is not a backend position: you will be directly engaging with executives at F500 (in many cases F50, or F10) companies as well as founders of game changing startups. We place this unparalleled level of trust in our associates because above all, RAs are the future leaders at the RB, and they are expected to rise to the challenge. The RA program builds RAs into leaders through training, mentorship, and through regular growth in roles and responsibilities (with scaling compensation to match). Many former associates have risen through the company, and we hire with this aim in mind.  When talking to people about what this job is like, there\u2019s a tri-partite Ven-diagram we like to draw. In ours, one circle is consulting, one is journalism, and one is think tank, and we say the RB style of work exists at the intersection of all three.  You\u2019ll be successful at the RB if you are creative and curious; an independent thinker and a team player; a fast learner and a great writer. RAs come from a spectrum of backgrounds, including public policy, economics, sociology, engineering, the sciences, and history. No matter what the RA\u2019s background, he or she or they is someone who loves to think critically and deeply. RAs think outside the box about cutting-edge technology issues and confidently share those ideas with colleagues and member CIOs.  What you'll do Draw thoughtful conclusions from a cacophony of data, both from RB members and from secondary research. Propose and test insightful ideas through primary and secondary research and convey them in polished written products. Identify industry leaders, academics, and startup executives, both to conduct research interviews and to build our extensive set of relationships with industry thought leaders. Master the research and RB processes, with an eye towards continuous innovation to ensure the RB continues to provide world-class service. What to expect Direct interaction with our membership of senior executives from Fortune Global 500 companies. Opportunity to meet and engage with renowned academics and key thinkers at established technology vendors and Silicon Valley startups. A highly thoughtful and intellectual (and fun!) work environment and colleagues who are well-rounded, deeply curious and love learning.  Qualifications  What You'll Need  B.A./B.S. degree.

Are you tired of making decisions purely based on data with no intuition? Do you enjoy the challenge of a highly dynamic ecosystem and an unpredictable industry? If so, this is the team for you!   Like all analytics teams, we believe that extracting actionable insight from data is the bedrock of good decision-making ... where we differ is in two key beliefs. First, the best decisions rely not solely on data, but also on intuition grounded in years of knowledge and experience. Second, if we only do marketing that we can easily or cleanly measure, we will fail.   If you thrive in a culture of healthy debate and are just as comfortable standing up for your ideas as you are changing your mind in the face of compelling evidence, logic, or intuition, then we want to hear from you. If you enjoy flipping seamlessly between the strategic big picture and the nuts and bolts, then we want to hear from you. If you can solve a Rubik\u2019s cube with one hand while winning a Clash Royale match with the other, it\u2019s not really relevant (but we still want to hear from you).   About the role   Food for thought: How might we measure the impact of placing a massive \"Hog Rider\" statue in Asia's largest underground mall? How would you decide whether we should show an ad in next year's Super Bowl? How should we think about the value of players who don't spend a cent, but contribute heavily to a game's community?   If tackling these kinds of questions gets you fired up, let's talk.   With over 100 million people playing our games every day, marketing at Supercell operates in uncharted territory, and analytics & data science are the compass. Always on the cutting edge of mobile advertising, marketers at Supercell experiment aggressively and adjust on the fly. We collect data and nurture intuition and constantly balance between the two while making strategic recommendations and tactical optimizations to guide everything from massive global multi-channel marketing campaigns to agile hyper-local experiments.   Above all, data scientists at Supercell enjoy partnering with colleagues to answer critical and difficult questions. They only care about getting to the best POV, regardless of whether that requires a rigorous statistical model, a simplistic ad hoc approach, or more likely some combination of multiple lenses. Our data scientists are not secluded Ivory Tower wizards, but collaborative problem-solvers. The qualities we look for:  Collaborative: you enjoy working hand-in-hand with colleagues more than not Strategic: you always have the strategic question in sight, and never get lost in the details or enamored with an inferior but intellectually more interesting approach Storytelling: You are adept at weaving compelling, thoughtful narratives from data Skeptical: you relish playing devil's advocate and being a professional, constructive skeptic Fearless: you are unafraid of uncertainty, and don't get paralyzed when grappling with tricky questions or lack of good data Adaptable: you are fully comfortable working in a team and industry that are constantly shifting and evolving  Requirements  5+ years of experience translating data to insight to recommendations BS (MS/PhD Preferred) in quant discipline (e.g. Math/Hard Science, Stats, CS, EE, Econ) Strong skills in SQL, R, and Python Experience in time series analytics and machine learning models is a plus  Experience  Develop and evolve statistical models to guide measurement and optimization Pilot new methods to measure brand new types of marketing efforts Design and own marketing experiments in partnership with our Media team Bridge the gap from data and analysis to critical business decisions Provide a data-driven POV to balance our team intuition Travel at your own discretion to our offices in Helsinki, Tokyo, Seoul and China  Why you'll love it here  Independence and lack of bureaucracy Opportunity to work with a team of gaming veterans, art veterans, top talent and passionate gamers Easy-going, enthusiastic, open and at the same time, a very results-driven culture Great compensation and benefits.

We believe the best people make the best games and that is who we are looking for. If you love games and are passionate about playing and crafting them, and you are looking for a job that provides you ownership and independence, this is the right place.   Supercell isn't an entertainment company, it isn't a start-up, and it isn't just any game company. our focus sets us apart. Focus means saying to to a lot. To release four games we have killed fourteen. We've shut down marketing campaigns because they weren't perfect for our players, and we've scrapped a ton of game features that were simply too niche.   We also believe that focus means staying small. We hire only the most passionate doers and arm them with the trust and support to make the biggest impact possible.
