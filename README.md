- ### General Assembly Projects – 2017/18
	- [Project 1](): Using historical AFL Data sourced primarily from CIKM 2015 – Machine Learning Challenge to predict winners of any AFL game in the season and apply our predictions to betting. Techniques used to produce the predictions include but are not limited to Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines(SVM), Gridsearch. The predictions are then run through Kelly Criterion to advise on the best ratio to bet.
